# Mage Client
A client for the game Mirage Online.
(MAGE CLIENT IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH MIRAGE ONLINE OR ITS CREATORS IN ANY WAY)

To run the client,
Run this in inspect element console:
fetch('https://aoipaka.github.io/mageclient/main.js',{'mode':'no-cors'}).then(r=>r.text()).then(t=>eval(t));

Don't think its safe?
The source code is right in main.js

# Mage Client
A client for the game Mirage Online.

To run the client,
Run this in inspect element console:
* Currently does not work, client source code must be manually pasted,
* working to fix
```js
import('https://aoipaka.github.io/mageclient/main.js')
```
Don't think its safe?
The source code is right in main.js
